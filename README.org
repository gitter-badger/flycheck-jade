* Flycheck-jade 

[[http://www.flycheck.org][Flycheck]] already has amazing support for many languages, but lacks support for Jade. Fearing that my code 
would not be merged into core, I have extracted the code into this extension.

* Todo 
 - Extract tests from Flycheck core contribution which (as of current) was not merged
